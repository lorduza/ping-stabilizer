  <h1>Ping Stabilizer</h1>
  <h3>Kill Lag Spikes. Stabilize Your PvP.</h3>
</div>

**Ping Stabilizer** is an advanced network optimization mod designed to make your Minecraft PvP experience as smooth as liquid. It doesn't just "lower ping"—it actively **stabilizes** your connection to prevent those annoying stutters and lag spikes that ruin combos.

> [!NOTE] 
> **Honest Disclaimer:** If you have severe physical network issues (e.g., bad ISP, faulty router, or you live on Mars), achieving 0ms is impossible. However, **Ping Stabilizer** will squeeze every drop of performance out of your current connection, ensuring your hit registration and PvP quality are significantly better than vanilla.

## Features
- **Jitter Stabilizer:** Automatically detects active lag spikes and prioritizes combat packets to stabilize connection.
- **Strict Low Delay:** Forces the OS to send Minecraft packets immediately (TCP Priority).
- **Anti-Bufferbloat:** Manages upload speed to prevent connection choking during heavy data transfer.
- **Network HUD:** Displays Ping, Jitter, and Stability Status on your screen.
- **Active Traffic Management:** Intelligently queues background packets to keep the line clear for PvP.
- **Mod Menu Integration:** Fully configurable settings.
- **Draggable HUD:** Press H to move stats, N to toggle visibility.
